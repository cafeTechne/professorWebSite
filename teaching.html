                <p>I approach teaching from a wholistic perspective. I see my job as a teacher as not
only that of helping students understand the material and practice critical
thinking; it is also that of guiding them in developing a critical consciousness of
the world that extends beyond the classroom. I implement this practice by
diversifying the curriculum, for instance by putting lesser-recognized authors and
topics in dialogue with the traditional cannon, practicing a trauma-informed
pedagogy in which I help students feel safe and secure in order that they can
learn effectively, and framing the content of the course in terms of its bearing on
real issues outside of the classroom, such as social justice and interpersonal
relationships.</p>

      feminist waves, including liberal feminism, radical feminism, socialist
      feminism, and existentialist feminism. The main themes of the class

      consequentialism, and virtue ethics, the class also looks at how
      conditions of injustice (like oppression, colonialism, and trauma) impact
      ethical theorizing and practice. This class asks students to learn the

      excitement for the material makes me happy to be in the class. She is organized, understanding to the things we have to deal with outside of class,
      and is just thorough. I never left the class confused. This class is truly one of
      those classes that [you're] happy to be in for the experience because the
      professor is so uniquely profound and great at what they do. I wouldn't have
      chosen another professor for this class. She embodies what a professor
      should be like at the university level!”</h4>
