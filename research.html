                My research is based on the conviction that ethical analysis can help us untangle some of the
                messiest and most important problems in human life. Specifically, I focus on questions of moral
                agency, self-regarding obligations, and ethical relationships under conditions of trauma and
                oppression (and their intersection). I argue for an approach to ethics that recognizes the burdens
                these agents face yet which does not reduce them to mere victims. My current projects involve
                arguing that responsibility under trauma ought to change our interpersonal practices of blame
                and identifying the connections between the morally damaging environment of intimate partner violence
                and gender oppression.

                    I argue that communities have a moral responsibility
to repair and prevent moral damage that some survivors of domestic violence
may experience. This responsibility is grounded in those communities' complicity
in domestic violence and the moral damage that may result. Drawing on Claudia
Card's work on domestic violence, I first explain two forms of moral damage that
some survivors may experience. These are: 1) normative isolation, or abusive
environments that are marked by distorted moral standards about the abuse
itself, and 2) coerced self-betrayal, the coercive entrapment of the survivor's

agency, emotions, and beliefs to express the will of the abuser. Though the
abuser is always the primary cause of abuse, I argue that survivors' communities
can contribute to a climate that facilitates domestic violence by, for instance,
sustaining harmful norms about gender roles, shaming survivors, protecting
abusers, and not wanting to interrupt “private matters.” When this complicity
exists, I argue that communities have a moral responsibility to create structures
that repair and prevent moral damage from domestic violence. Finally, I sketch
out some practical considerations for building these structures. These involve
creating violence-resistant communities that protect survivors, hold abusers
accountable, and help survivors reclaim their agencies.

                  A common question in moral philosophy concerns
                  how we should regard traumatic histories that have influenced wrongdoing. In
                  this paper, I argue that one standard line of response—survivors are exempt
                  from blame for a given wrongdoing because of a traumatic history that
                  influenced this wrongdoing—is problematic. Instead of trying to determine how
                  trauma categorically exempts survivors from blame, I argue that we should start
                  from the fact that survivors are members of the moral community who can be as
                  blameworthy as anyone, and then ask how considerations of trauma might
                  impact a moral response to their wrongdoing. I consider and reject three
                  attempts to exempt survivors on the grounds of traumatic histories, arguing that
                  each risks divesting survivors of moral agency. I then develop an account
                  of compassionate blame, a unique attitude in which we can blame the survivor
                  for their wrong while also taking compassion towards the survivor in light of
                  their traumatic history, and argue that this is the appropriate moral attitude to
                  cultivate in these cases.

                  In this paper, I assess one dimension of self-injury through a framework of psychological oppression. Certain effects of psychological oppression, I argue, share a surprising degree of overlap with subjective features of self-injury, and may thereby partly explain socially marginalized agents’ high risk of self-injury. I first discuss certain subjective features of self-injury that are particularly salient in agents’ self-reports. I then canvass some of the literature on the risk of self-injury among members of socially marginalized groups. Focusing on one socio-cultural analysis of self-injury as a start, I discuss Sarah Naomi Shaw’s (2002) feminist analysis of self-injury. I argue that while Shaw’s analysis pays important attention to certain features of self-injury, its reliance on white feminine socialization, and body and beauty norms in particular, is overly restrictive. Finally, using Sandra Bartky’s (1990) conception of psychological oppression, I focus on three features of psychological oppression and their connections to self-injury: 1) self-loathing and intra-self fragmentation; 2) bodily objectification; and 3) shame over acting out one’s agency.

                  Common sense morality tells us we should help our friends, family, and loved ones when they suffer. However, some people are hell-bent on being unhappy, and will do everything in their power to ensure their own suffering. This creates a dilemma about what we ought to do for someone who puts themselves in pain and refuses to budge. In this paper, I discuss mechanisms of and motivations for self-sabotaging behavior. I then turn to the ethical complications of these cases, focusing on the risk of becoming complicit in another’s self-sabotage, the acceptable limits of caring for a self-saboteur, and the permissibility of paternalistic interference. I argue that while there is some degree of leeway we can permissibly give to meet another’s needs—including submitting to their low-stakes manipulation—doing so poses the risk of damaging the relationship. While interference in another’s self-sabotage for his own good may seem justified, I argue that this approach is also a morally problematic denial of the self-saboteur’s agency. Instead, I offer an alternative route between complicity and interference: carers ought to try to maintain a genuine relationship build on the honest recognition of each other’s reasons. This will mean the carer should talk to the self-saboteur about her own concerns and the strain the self-sabotage puts on the relationship while also appreciating that the self-saboteur may have legitimate reasons to suffer in an effort to find a resolution that both parties can accept.

                  Moral questions surrounding suffering tend to focus on obligations to relieve others’ suffering. In this paper, I focus on the overlooked question of what sufferers morally owe to themselves, arguing that they have the duty to self-care. I discuss agents who have been shaped by moral luck to contribute to their own suffering and canvass the ways in which this damages moral agency. I contend that these agents have a duty to care for themselves by protecting and expanding their agency, which involves precluding further destruction of agency and ensuring the continued ability to self-care.
